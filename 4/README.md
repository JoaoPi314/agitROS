# Log messages
*In which we generate and view log messages*.

We have already seen, in the example programs from Chapter 3, a macro called ROS-
_INFO_STREAM that displays informative messages to the user. These messages are
examples of **log messages**. ROS provides a rich logging system that includes ROS_INFO-
_STREAM along with a number of other features. In this chapter, weâ€™ll see how to use
that logging system.
