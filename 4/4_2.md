# **4.2 An example program**

The remainder of this chapter deals with how to generate and view log messages. As
usual, it will be helpful to have a concrete example program to illustrate what’s going
on. It would be possible to use turtlesim for this purpose—under the right conditions,
turtlesim_node will produce log messages at every level except FATAL—but for learning purposes it will be more convenient to work with a program that produces lots of log
messages at predictable intervals.
Listing 4.1 shows a program that fits this description. It generates a steady stream of
messages at all five severity levels. An example of its console output appears in Listing 4.2.
We’ll use this as a running example throughout the rest of the chapter.
