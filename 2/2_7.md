# Topics and messages

In our `turtlesim` example, it’s clear that the teleoperation node and the simulator node
must be talking to each other somehow. Otherwise, how would the turtle, which lives in
the latter node, know when to move in response to your key presses, which are collected
by the former node?

The primary mechanism that ROS nodes use to communicate is to send **messages**.
Messages in ROS are organized into named [**topics**](http://wiki.ros.org/ROS/Tutorials/UnderstandingTopics).
The idea is that a node that wants to share information will **publish** messages on 
the appropriate topic or topics; a node that wants to receive information will **subscribe** 
to the topic or topics that it’s interested in. The ROS master takes care of ensuring
that publishers and subscribers can find each other; the messages themselves are sent 
directly from publisher to subscriber.

## Viewing the graph

This idea is probably easiest to see graphically, and the easiest way to visualize the publish-
subscribe relationships between ROS nodes is to use this command:

```
rqt_graph
```

In this name, the r is for ROS, and the qt refers to the Qt GUI toolkit used to implement
the program. You should see a GUI, most of which is devoted to showing the nodes in the
current system. In this case, you will see something like the [Figure 2.2](#2.2). In this graph, the ovals
represent nodes, and the directed edges represent publisher-subscriber relationships. The
graph tells us that the node named `/teleop_turtle` publishes messages on a topic called
`/turtle1/cmd_vel`, and that the node named `/turtlesim` subscribes to those messages.
(In this context, the name "`cmd_vel` is short for "command velocity.")

You might notice that the rosout node that we saw in Section 2.6 is missing from this
view. By default, `rqt_graph` hides nodes that it thinks exist only for debugging. You can
disable this feature by unchecking the "Hide debug" box. [Figure 2.3](#2.3) shows the resulting
graph.

- Notice that `rqt_graph` itself appears as a node.
- All of these nodes publish messages on a topic called `/rosout`, to which the node
named `/rosout` subscribes. This topic is one mechanism through which nodes can
generate textual log messages. Chapter 4 has more about logging in ROS.

This view of debug nodes is useful for seeing a true picture of the current state of things,
but can also clutter the graph quite a bit with information that is not often very helpful.
The `rqt_graph` tool has several other options for tweaking the way that it shows the
graph. The author’s personal preference is to change the dropdown from "Nodes only" to
"Nodes/Topics (all)", and to disable all of the checkboxes except "Hide Debug." This setup,
whose results are shown in [Figure 2.4](#2.4), has the advantage that all of the topics are shown
in rectangles, separate from the nodes. One can see, for example, that the `turtlesim` node,
in addition to subscribing to velocity commands, also publishes both its current pose and
data from a simulated color sensor. When you’re exploring a new ROS system, `rqt_graph`,
especially with these options, can be a useful way to discover what topics are available for
your programs to use to communicate with the existing nodes.

Now we can understand at least part of how the `turtlesim` teleoperation system works.
When you press a key, the `/teleop_turtle` node publishes messages with those movement
commands on a topic called `/turtle1/cmd_vel`. Because it subscribes to that topic, the
`turtlesim_node` receives those messages, and simulates the turtle moving with the requested velocity. 
The important points here are:

- The simulator doesn’t care (or even know) which program publishes those `cmd_vel`
messages. Any program that publishes on that topic can control the turtle.
- The teleoperation program doesn’t care (or even know) which program subscribes
to the `cmd_vel` messages it publishes. Any program that subscribes to that topic is
free to respond to those commands.

By the way, these topic names begin with `/turtle1` because they are concerned with the
default turtle, whose name happens to be "turtle1." We’ll see, in Chapter 8, how to add
additional turtles to a `turtlesim` window.
